# Jumbo Run

A simple vertically scrolling video game in which the player views the field of play principally from a top-down perspective, while the background scrolls from the top of the screen to the bottom. This creates the illusion that the player character is moving in the game world.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
